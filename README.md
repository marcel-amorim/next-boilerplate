This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Boilerplate created using Typescript, ReactJS & Styled Components

## Getting Started

First, use this as a boilerplate
```bash
yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/marcel-amorim/next-boilerplate
```


Second, run the development server:

```bash
# cd your_folder
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
